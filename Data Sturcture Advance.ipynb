    "#This function takes a dictionary (input_dict) as input and returns a new dictionary where the keys and values are swapped.\n",
    "#We iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary:\n",
    "#If the value is already a key in the inverted dictionary, we append the current key to the list of keys that share this value.\n",
    "#If the value is not in the inverted dictionary, we create a new entry with the value as the key and a list containing the current key as its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example usage:\n",
    "#The dictionary input_dict has some repeated values (1 and 2).\n",
    "#After inverting the dictionary, the values that appeared more than once are stored as lists of their respective keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Inverted dictionary: {1: ['a', 'c'], 2: ['b', 'e'], 3: ['d']}\n",
    "\n",
    "#Key Points:\n",
    "#Handling duplicates: If multiple keys have the same value, they are stored in a list under that value in the inverted dictionary.\n",
    "#Flexible for any dictionary: This code works for dictionaries where values can be either unique or repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#This solution handles all cases efficiently, ensuring that the inverted dictionary preserves the relationships between keys and values, even when values are not unique."
